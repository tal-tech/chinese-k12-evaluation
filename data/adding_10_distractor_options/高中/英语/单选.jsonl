While the exact cause of autism is unknown, its development in children has been linked to various factors—including zinc deficiency （锌缺乏）.\n\nAccording to a paper published in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience, the researchers demonstrated how zinc shapes synapses （突触） during their early development. \"Autism is associated with variants （变异） of genes involved in the formation and maturation of synapses, \" said Sally Kim, lead author of the study from Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\nThe team found that when a brain signal was transferred via a synapse, zinc entered the target neuron （神经元）， where it could combine two proteins, SHANK2 and SHANK3. Those proteins cause changes in the composition and function of the synapse.\n\nThe finding that zinc shapes the development of synapses via SHANK proteins suggests that a lack of zinc during development could potentially  damage the function of synapses, which enable brain cells to communicate with one another.\n\n…\n\nIt's important to note, however, that at present it isn't possible to make any concrete conclusions or begin recommending that children take zinc supplements.\n\nWhat do we know about autism according to the passage? \n", "answer_option": ["A.It is a common mental illness among children", "B.It is mainly caused by zinc deficiency", "C.It can be cured with the latest advance in neuroscience", "D.It is associated with specific variants of genes", "E.before\n", "F.I beg to differ", "G.She stopped the others from hurting the girl", "H.a lot of tapes were bought by Jenny's father\n", "I.played a joke on\n", "J.He wanted to take a voyage", "K.at hand\n", "L.when\n", "M.are regarded\n", "N.though\n"], "answer": "D", "analysis": "细节理解题。根据文章第二段中“Autism is associated with variants (变异) of genes involved in the formation and maturation of synapses.(自闭症与参与突触形成和成熟的基因变异有关)”可知，自闭症和基因变异有关。故选C。\n", "task_type": "单选", "task_subject": "英语", "task_grade": "高中", "task_semester": "", "difficulty": "中档", "knowledge_tree": "科学与技术-科技发展与信息技术创新", "knowledge_domain": ["高中", "英语", "题型", "阅读理解", "阅读理解"]}
